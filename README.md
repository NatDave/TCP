  ## Data-Driven Decision Support 
+ I took this course in the second semester of my PhD.
+ It presents *supervised* and *unsupervised* methods for dealing with large data sets and their application to support decision making in various areas.
+ Focuses on predictive models and methods for knowledge mining.
+ Discusses applications from the transportation, urban mobility, and infrastructure maintenance domains.
+ Demonstrates the applicability and underlying principles of the various methods through case studies with extensive data sets.

+ ***Topics include***:
  - [x] Regression: Simple Linear, Multiple Linear, Polynomial, Ridge and Lasso Regression
  - [x] Classification: Logistic regression, kNN, Decision Trees, LDA, SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks
